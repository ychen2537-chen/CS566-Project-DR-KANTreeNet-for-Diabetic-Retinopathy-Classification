# CS566-Project-DR-KANTreeNet-for-Diabetic-Retinopathy-Classification
**DR-KANTreeNet**
An enhanced deep learning framework for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) classification using:

🧠 KAN-based modules for better feature representation.

🌳 Vessel-tree modeling to capture vascular structures.

🔗 Multi-branch fusion of CNN, ViT, and vessel features.

⚡ Multi-GPU support with efficient training tricks.

🌟 **Highlights**

Lesion-aware attention: Focuses on subtle DR lesions.

VesselTreeNet: Learns tree-like vessel structures linked to disease severity.

Quad-modal fusion: Combines CNN, ViT, and vessel features with graph refinement.

Robust training: Advanced augmentation, class-balanced loss, mixup, and cross-validation.

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the **APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection** dataset from Kaggle.

- Place training images in:  
```data/train_images/```

- Labels file should be:  
```data/train.csv```

## 🚀 Training

Example (multi-GPU, mixed precision):

```bash
python All_KANS_Sencond.py --bs 16 --ep 30 --img 384 --amp
Options:

--bs: batch size

--ep: number of epochs

--img: input image size

--amp: enable automatic mixed precision
